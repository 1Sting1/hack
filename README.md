# Course Area

I started my journey as a first-year student in Software Development with a mixture of excitement and a bit of trepidation. Balancing my studies and my new job at StroySoftware was challenging.

### Learning Go

One of my first tasks was to familiarize myself with the Go programming language. I started by going through the official Go documentation, which was well-structured and easy to follow. I practiced by writing small programs, which helped solidify my understanding of Goâ€™s syntax and features. The concurrency model in Go, with its goroutines and channels, was particularly fascinating and required a deep dive into examples and use cases.

### Diving into FastAPI

Next, I had to learn FastAPI for a project that required building a RESTful API. The official FastAPI documentation was my primary resource. I appreciated the clear examples and the emphasis on modern Python type hints, which made the code more readable and helped with autocompletion in my IDE. I built a simple API to manage a to-do list, experimenting with various endpoints, query parameters, and request bodies.

### Understanding IOGramm and GPIO

Working with hardware interfaces like IOGramm and GPIO was entirely new to me. I started with the basic concepts of GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) by reading tutorials and the official Raspberry Pi documentation. I learned how to control LEDs and read input from buttons, which involved a bit of Python coding. For IOGramm, I explored its documentation to understand how it facilitates communication between different hardware components.

### Mastering Linux

Linux was another critical area for my development. I had some prior experience, but I needed to deepen my understanding. I spent time reading the Linux Documentation Project and various man pages. I practiced common commands, wrote shell scripts, and managed processes. Understanding the file system hierarchy and permissions was crucial, and I also explored tools like grep, awk, and sed for text processing.

### Grasping HTTP/HTTPS

Understanding HTTP and HTTPS protocols was essential for web development. I read RFC 2616 for HTTP/1.1 and RFC 2818 for HTTP over TLS/SSL. I also explored various online resources and documentation to understand the request-response cycle, headers, status codes, and secure communication using HTTPS. Practical experience came from using tools like Postman to test APIs and inspect headers and payloads.

### Studying Physics and Electronics

Physics and electronics were part of my curriculum and directly relevant to some projects at StroySoftware. I attended lectures, did lab experiments, and studied textbooks. Understanding basic electronic components like resistors, capacitors, transistors, and their roles in circuits was foundational. I also built simple circuits on a breadboard and simulated them using software like Tinkercad and LTSpice.

### Integrating Knowledge

Integrating all these areas of knowledge was key. For instance, a project required creating a web interface to control an electronic device via GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi. This project combined my understanding of FastAPI (to build the API), Linux (to manage the server), and GPIO (to interface with the hardware). I also had to ensure secure communication (using HTTPS) and validate data formats (using principles from HTTP).

### Conclusion

The experience was intense but incredibly enriching. Balancing theoretical knowledge from my coursework with practical application at StroySoftware helped solidify my skills. Each piece of technology I learned built on the others, creating a comprehensive understanding that I could apply to real-world problems. This journey not only made me a better developer but also prepared me for future challenges in the ever-evolving field of software development.
